## Why these exist

`schema.sql` shipped with four defects that made the database unusable. Measured
against the live project as the `anon` role, before any of this ran:

```
applications   -> 42P17 infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"
jobs           -> 42P17
companies      -> 42P17
profiles       -> 42P17
job_categories -> OK, 0 rows   (165 exist)
job_locations  -> OK, 0 rows   ( 65 exist)
```

Four of six tables threw at the database layer for every visitor; the other two
silently returned nothing. The homepage swallowed the error and rendered "No live
roles yet", which is why this went unnoticed — nothing in the UI said *error*.

1. **42P17 recursion.** `admins full access profiles` ran
   `exists (select 1 from profiles ...)` in a policy *on* `profiles`. The same
   subquery was copy-pasted into the admin policies on three more tables, so it
   was not contained. Fixed by moving the test into `security definer
   is_admin()` — 001.
2. **RLS on with no policy** on the two lookup tables, courtesy of the
   `ensure_rls` event trigger. A silent lockout — 002.
3. **No INSERT policy on `profiles`**, so the client-side insert in
   `register/page.tsx` was denied and its error never checked. Every signup
   produced an `auth.users` row with no profile — 003. The backfill in 003
   recovered the two existing accounts.
4. **`applicant_id = auth.uid()` on INSERT**, which is `NULL = NULL` → NULL for
   a guest, so the public apply form could never succeed; and employer read
   keyed on `companies.owner_id` while employer write keyed on `posted_by`, so
   jobs missing a `company_id` had invisible applicants — 004.

## What was verified after applying (001–006)

Each was probed by impersonating the actual role (`set role` + a synthetic
`request.jwt.claims`), not from a superuser session where RLS is bypassed:

- All 42P17 errors gone for `anon` and `authenticated`; `is_admin()` returns
  `false` cleanly.
- `job_categories` 165 rows / `job_locations` 65 rows readable by anon; anon
  writes denied (42501).
- Signup trigger: `role: "admin"` supplied in client metadata is **downgraded to
  `seeker`**; `employer` honoured; `full_name` trimmed.
- `anon` sees **0 of 4,355** applications; can insert against a published job;
  denied against a draft (42501); denied when forging `applicant_id` (42501).
- Employer A sees and updates only their own applicants; employer B sees 0 and
  their update matches 0 rows.
- Claim flow: a **confirmed** address claimed exactly its 6 rows and re-claiming
  added 0; an **unconfirmed** address with 6 matching rows counted 0 and claimed
  0.
- `stats()` as anon returns `applications=4355` while row reads still return 0.

All probe fixtures were removed. `applications` ends at 4,355 rows, all
unclaimed, and `auth.users` at 2.

## After 007

Verified by impersonating each role, then cleaned up:

- `cvs` bucket is private, capped at 5 MB, and restricted to `application/pdf`
  at the storage layer — not just in the form.
- `anon` may INSERT into the bucket (guests apply) and has no read, list,
  update or delete.
- A published job is visible to a signed-out visitor, including its joined
  employer and category; a `draft` or `closed` job is not.
- A guest application against a published job is accepted.

`it@pac.africa` is now confirmed and holds `role = 'admin'`.

## After 008–010

- `update_updated_at` now has `search_path = ''`; its trigger still fires
  (verified by touching a row and watching `updated_at` advance).
- `rls_auto_enable` is no longer executable by `anon` or `authenticated`. The
  first attempt failed silently: it revoked the named roles but not `PUBLIC`,
  which is where the grant actually came from.
- **`anon` now holds `EXECUTE` on `stats()` and nothing else.** Migrations
  001/005/006 had revoked `PUBLIC` and granted the roles that needed it, which
  looked correct but wasn't — Supabase's `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` had already
  attached an *explicit* `anon` grant to every new function, so revoking PUBLIC
  never removed it. No exploit: each function returns early when `auth.uid()` is
  null. Closed in `010`.
- `handle_new_user`, `update_updated_at` and `guard_company_verified` are
  trigger-only and unreachable over the API. Their triggers still work —
  Postgres checks `EXECUTE` when a trigger is created, not when it fires.
- `guard_company_verified` re-verified against the real company owner (not a
  random uuid, which RLS rejects before the trigger is reached): an employer
  gets `verified may only be changed by an admin`, while ordinary edits pass.
- `cvs` bucket: private, 60 MB, pdf + doc + docx.

## After 011–016

- `stats()` revoked from `anon`, then the landing-page counts removed. **`anon`
  could execute nothing in `public` at this point** — 017 and 023 each added one
  back, deliberately; see below.
- 012 closed an employer publish-bypass: `guard_job_status()` made every route
  into `published` admin-only, and the `company_id` predicate in the jobs
  policy was constrained so an employer could not attach a listing to someone
  else's company.
- 013 put `cvs` back to 5 MB PDF-only once R2 held the archive, and added a
  partial unique index so the same address cannot be filed against the same
  listing twice. The 4,355 archive rows have `job_id` NULL and are excluded.
- 015 renamed `benefits` → `qualifications`, matching a product decision.
- 016 dropped `companies_select_public`. The employer behind a role became
  admin-only information — which 017 then depended on without noticing, and 023
  had to repair.

## After 017–023 (the dashboards)

Four things the brief's dashboards needed and the schema lacked (017), plus what
building on them exposed.

- **`application_events` + `log_application_status()`** — the drawer's history.
  Written by trigger, not by the app, so it is complete even for a change made
  through the API or a SQL console.
- **Suspension** (`suspended_at` on `profiles` and `companies`) started as a
  label. 022 made it bite: a suspended seeker cannot insert an application and a
  suspended employer cannot insert or update a listing, both by trigger, so the
  refusal holds against a direct API call rather than only against the UI.
- **023 is a fix, and the most instructive item here.** 017's suspension check
  lived inside `jobs_select_published` as a subquery against `companies`. A
  policy subquery runs with the **caller's** privileges, and 016 had just removed
  public read on `companies` — so for `anon` it returned zero rows regardless,
  `not exists` was always true, and a suspended employer's listings stayed
  public. The check now lives in `company_suspended()`, a `security definer`
  function returning one boolean.

  **A policy predicate must not depend on RLS the caller does not have.**
- **019 + 021 reopened two doors 012 had closed too far.** `approved_at` is
  stamped on publish and cleared by any non-admin edit to reviewed content, which
  lets an employer resume a listing they paused without re-review while keeping
  "nothing public without review" true. 021 lets an employer insert a `draft`,
  which the post form's save-as-draft needs; `draft` is not publicly visible.
- **020 exists because `profiles` is row-level.** The inbox shows an applicant's
  headline and avatar, both on `profiles`, whose policy is own-row-or-admin.
  Widening it would have handed over phone, address, bio, LinkedIn and
  `cv_url` too. `applicant_cards(uuid[])` returns those two columns, only for
  applications on jobs the caller owns, and takes application ids rather than a
  person — so there is no way to ask it about someone.
- **018 added two buckets.** `avatars` is private and read-scoped like a CV;
  `logos` is public because a corporate mark is branding. Both key their
  policies on the first path segment rather than on `storage.objects.owner`,
  which is NULL for service-role writes — the trap 007 hit with the CV archive.

### Verified by probe, as the real roles

Each of these was run with `set_config('role', …)` plus synthetic
`request.jwt.claims`, never from a superuser session:

| behaviour | result |
|---|---|
| employer inserts a draft | stays `draft`, `approved_at` null |
| employer publishes their own draft | blocked — "only an administrator can publish" |
| admin publishes | `approved_at` stamped |
| employer pauses then resumes | allowed |
| employer edits the title | `approved_at` cleared |
| employer resumes after editing | blocked — "edited since it was approved" |
| guest application | one `application_events` row written |
| employer moves it twice | history reads `new→pending, pending→under_review, under_review→shortlisted` |
| employer suspends another account | 0 rows — RLS never reaches the trigger |
| employer suspends their own company | blocked by trigger |
| suspended employer clears their own suspension | blocked by trigger; suspension survives |
| suspended seeker applies | blocked — "this account is suspended" |
| anon views a suspended employer's listing | 0 rows |
| after reinstating | 1 row |
| employer requests 2 applicant cards, owns 1 | gets 1 |
| applicant requests their own 2 | gets 2 |
| admin requests both | gets 2 |

Three probe mistakes of my own, recorded because they each read as a security
hole and were not:

1. `insert … returning` **as `anon`** fails with "new row violates row-level
   security policy" — `RETURNING` needs a SELECT policy, and a guest has none.
   The real apply form does a bare insert, so it works. The error message names
   the wrong cause.
2. An employer updating another user's row reports **success with 0 rows
   affected**. RLS denies by matching nothing, so asserting on "no error" reads a
   denial as a bypass. Assert on `row_count`.
3. Setting `suspended_at` from null **to null** does not trip the guard,
   because `is distinct from` is false. A no-op is not a bypass — make the
   values actually differ.

## After 024–025 (closing the write surface, and what that review found)

**024** removed the anonymous write surface. `applications_insert_public` (004)
granted INSERT to `anon` because the apply form ran in the browser, which made
`POST /rest/v1/applications` an open, unauthenticated write endpoint on the most
sensitive table here — and one nothing at the edge could protect, because the
request goes to Supabase and never reaches Vercel. Storage was the same:
`cvs_insert` let `anon` upload. Both are gone. Signed-in applicants now insert
under a policy; guests go through a server action that writes with the service
role via `submit_guest_application()`, which fixes the column list and forces
`applicant_id` to null.

**025 is the important one, and it did not come from planned work.** A security
review of 024 found a privilege escalation that had been live since migration
001:

> `profiles_update` was `using (auth.uid() = id or is_admin())` with the same
> WITH CHECK. That constrains the **row** and RLS has no column granularity, so
> any registered user could send
>
>     PATCH /rest/v1/profiles?id=eq.<own-uid>   {"role":"admin"}
>
> with the public anon key and their own token. `handle_new_user` (003)
> whitelists the role supplied at *signup*, so the insert was covered and the
> update was not.

Verified against the live database before fixing: a seeker promoted itself and
read **4,355 of 4,356** application rows. That unlocks every admin policy,
`cvs_select_admin`, the publish bypass in `guard_job_status`, and all of
`/admin`. It is the most serious defect found in this rebuild.

`guard_profile_columns()` now blocks non-admin changes to `role` and `email`,
and confines `company_id` to a company the caller owns.

**Why a trigger and not `revoke update (role)`.** The column revoke looks
tighter and is wrong here: Supabase admins *are* the `authenticated` role, so a
column privilege cannot tell them apart from a seeker, and revoking the column
would also stop an admin changing a role or suspending an account. Column
privileges cannot see who is asking; a trigger calling `is_admin()` can.

025 also tightened two things the same review surfaced:

- `applications_insert_own` constrained `status` to `pending` and added the
  seeker-only gate the application code had assumed was already there — without
  it any authenticated account, including an employer, could POST an application
  already marked `hired`.
- `cvs_select_employer` (007) matched on `a.cv_url = storage.objects.name` with
  no constraint on who wrote that row, so an employer could insert an
  application against their own job with `cv_url` set to a path they had seen
  elsewhere and gain indefinite read on it — the shape 012 closed for applicants
  and left open here. Rows the caller filed themselves are now excluded.

### Verified by probe, after 025

| behaviour | result |
|---|---|
| seeker sets own `role = 'admin'` | blocked |
| seeker rewrites own `email` | blocked |
| seeker points `company_id` at another company | blocked |
| seeker edits name/phone/headline | still works |
| insert an application with `status = 'hired'` | blocked |
| employer files an application | blocked |
| seeker files their own application | still works |
| admin changes someone's role | still works |
| `anon` inserts an application | permission denied for table |
| `anon` calls `submit_guest_application` | permission denied for function |
| `anon` uploads to `cvs` | RLS violation |
| `service_role` writes a guest application | 1 row |

### Two lessons worth keeping

1. **RLS is row-level. It says nothing about columns.** Every policy of the form
   `auth.uid() = id` on a table that holds a privilege column needs a trigger
   beside it. This one shipped as part of the migration that *fixed* the RLS
   recursion, and survived a prior security review.
2. **A comment asserting an invariant is not the invariant.** `app/jobs/actions.ts`
   claimed a signed-in applicant's address "is never read from the form", which
   was true and beside the point: it was read from `profiles.email`, which the
   same user could rewrite. It now comes from `auth.users` via the session.

## After 026

launch-checks.md (S11/S17): rate limiting was zero anywhere, confirmed in the
Vercel firewall log (`Rate Limited –`, `Custom Rules 0`). Sign-in traffic goes
straight to Supabase Auth, so that side is a dashboard setting, not a
migration. But the apply flow has been a server action on our own origin
since 024, so it is the one write path this project can throttle itself
without depending on whether Vercel's WAF custom rules are available on the
current plan.

`rate_limit_hit(key, max, window_seconds)` is a fixed-window counter, keyed
on a **hashed** IP (never the raw address, consistent with 013's stance on
IP-level tracking of anonymous applicants), `security definer`, `execute`
granted to `service_role` only — called from `lib/rate-limit.ts` via the
admin client, the same scoped-elevated-access pattern `lib/supabase/admin.ts`
already asks for rather than a second raw table caller. `app/jobs/actions.ts`
calls it once, at 8 requests per 15 minutes per hashed IP — deliberately
generous, since Kenyan mobile traffic sits behind carrier NAT and this only
needs to catch a script, not a shared connection.

Cleanup is probabilistic (1 in ~100 calls deletes buckets older than a day)
rather than a cron job, since the table only ever holds recent windows for
keys actually being hit.

**Confirmed applied 2026-08-31** — `public.rate_limits` exists and
`rate_limit_hit()` is present on the live database (checked directly via
`information_schema`/`pg_proc`, project `khdvagjfonbiezkybpvh`). The
behaviour table below is still unprobed by impersonation; only existence has
been confirmed, not the runtime behaviour:

| behaviour to check | expected |
|---|---|
| 8 apply attempts from the same hashed IP within 15 minutes | 9th is rejected with `rate_limited` |
| a different hashed IP, same window | unaffected |
| after the window rolls over | counter resets, attempts succeed again |
| `anon`/`authenticated` call `rate_limit_hit()` directly | permission denied for function |

## Still open

- **Leaked-password protection** is still off (Supabase → Auth → Policies). The
  only advisor finding that is not a deliberate design choice.
- **Keep email confirmation on.** Migration 006 treats a confirmed address as
  proof of ownership, so turning it off would make the claim flow an
  account-takeover path onto a decade of other people's contact details.
- **`types/database.ts` is hand-maintained** across 23 migrations. Replace it
  with `supabase gen types typescript --project-id khdvagjfonbiezkybpvh`.
- **No automated assertion of any of the above.** The probe table is a snapshot
  of one afternoon, not a regression test.

### Resolved

- The CV archive is migrated: 3,936 rows repointed to R2, 0 failures, 1,214 MB.
  178 rows remain unrecoverable — they reference 2015–2019 uploads and the
  recovered archive starts 2023-04-01.
- The legacy `https://jobs.pac.africa/wp-content/...` URLs do **not** resolve.
  That was recorded here as "they do still resolve", which was wrong: the domain
  moved to Vercel, so those paths hit Next.js and 404. Anything still holding one
  renders as "pending migration" rather than as a dead link.

## After 028

Three notification-preference columns on `profiles`: `notify_email` (master
switch for application/status/decision emails), `notify_new_jobs` (seeker
opt-in to hear about every new publish), `notify_pending_review` (admin
opt-in to hear about the review queue). All self-editable under the existing
`profiles_update` policy — none of the three touch role, email or company_id,
so `guard_profile_columns` (025) has no reason to guard them.

**Confirmed applied 2026-08-31** — all three columns exist on the live
`profiles` table (checked directly, project `khdvagjfonbiezkybpvh`). The
behaviour table below is still unprobed:

| behaviour to check | expected |
|---|---|
| a seeker flips `notify_email` off, then their application is moved to `shortlisted` | no email sent |
| a seeker opts into `notify_new_jobs`, admin publishes any job | seeker receives one email |
| an employer flips `notify_email` off, a guest applies to their job | no email sent to the employer |
| a fresh admin row (default `notify_pending_review = true`) | receives an email the next time a job enters `pending_review` |

## After 029–033

All five confirmed applied and live 2026-08-31 (via direct
`information_schema`/`pg_proc`/`pg_type` checks against project
`khdvagjfonbiezkybpvh` — not previously documented here, despite landing in
commit `c7628ad`, 26 Aug):

- **029** — `application_reviews`, an append-only per-reviewer log
  (`overview` / `final`), separate from any status field on `applications`.
- **030** — `dashboard_landing` / `dashboard_density` on `profiles`, cosmetic
  and self-editable, validated at write time in
  `app/dashboard/settings-actions.ts` rather than constrained in the schema.
- **031** — work-email-only employer signup enforced server-side (the
  client check in `lib/employer-email.ts` is only a fast path), plus
  `jobs.required_skills`.
- **032** — `candidate_matches(p_job_id, p_industry_category_id)`, admin-only
  (gated by `is_admin()` inside the function, same pattern as every other
  admin RPC), ranks every seeker against a job's `required_skills`.
- **033** — multi-entry `profile_education` / `profile_work_experience`
  tables, job-side requirement columns (`required_years_experience`,
  `required_education_level`, `required_industry_category_id`),
  application-side snapshot columns (`years_experience`, `expected_salary`,
  `current_salary`, `consented_at`, `consent_version`, `meets_requirements`).
  `meets_requirements` is a flag surfaced to admin/employer, never an
  automatic rejection.

None of these have been probed by role-impersonation yet — only schema
presence is confirmed. Worth a probe pass before leaning on them further.
